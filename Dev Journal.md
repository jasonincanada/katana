I started keeping a budget using https://ynab.com/ at the start of this month and quickly realized 1) how beneficial it is and 2) that katana must become this and improve on it. Many years back I started using YNAB when it was a desktop app. It didn't really "click" for me back then like it has now, so I didn't stick with it. But I've been obsessed with it since the start of the month, wondering how to use technology to spread this very powerful way of taking control of your financial life.

In the meantime, I'm doing twice the accounting work entering my usual transaction entries in my normal ledger, then repeating them in YNAB. So the obvious thing is to create a new UI that absorbs both expense tracking and budgeting, and see if I can scale it.

### Areas for innovation

- Helping people with understanding credit card transactions in the context of a budget. It took a few minutes to grok this in YNAB so I'm trying to think up some clever way of stepping first-time budgeters through it. I'm collecting anecdotes of user experiences from the [YNAB reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ynab/) and this seems to be a common pain point

- It's no wonder this financial strategy isn't more widely employed, it's overwhelming at first and I imagine the complexity throws a lot of people off the trail. So there's big opportunity here, maybe for some sort of AI-like experience in the UI itself, like watching a person demonstrating how to do it and their thought process, something like that

ChatGPT has been a powerful assistant so far. I had this exchange with it today: https://sharegpt.com/c/25OHfqw
